<p style="color:blue;">Who Am I?</p>
<p>I am a student at Dublin Coffman Highschool in the 11th grade.  I am a squad leader in the marching band, and I enjoy to play a lot of instruments, as well as listen to a lot of music.  I like to program and engineer things, which is the career path I plan on taking.  My hobbies are playing video games, hanging out with my friends, and watching shows and movies.</p>

<p>If I could start any business right now, it would probably be some sort of software or website where I could create video games, or possibly some sort of music software, to help people practice or create music.</p>

<p>My main goal in life is to be happy, because that is all that really matters to me in the end.  To obtain this, hard work is necessary to be successful financially, physically, and emotionally, and I think if I can acheive these three things, that is all I really need.  I do not need to be a millionare, I just want a happy home and a happy family.</p>
